# Book Management App

This is a simple book management application built using **React** and **Axios** for handling HTTP requests. The app allows users to add books to a list, with each book's data including title, author, genre, publication date, and description. When a new book is added, the backend returns an ID which is then appended to the book data.

## Features

- Add books to the collection.
- Display a success message when a book is successfully added.
- Reset the form after successfully adding a book.
- Automatically fetch and display newly added books with an ID.

## Technologies Used

- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Toastify**: For displaying success/error messages.
- **Node.js & Express**: (Assumed) Backend to handle book additions and serve data.
